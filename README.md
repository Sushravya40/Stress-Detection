This project focuses on detecting stress levels in IT professionals using machine learning techniques.  
It uses data preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification models to predict stress levels.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature extraction from datasets
- Machine learning model training (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks)
- Model evaluation with accuracy and performance metrics
- Visualization of results

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Flask / Streamlit (for deployment, if used)
- MySQL / SQLite (if database is used)
